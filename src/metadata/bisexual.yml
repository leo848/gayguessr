title: bisexual

aliases: [ bi ]

description: '
  Bisexuality is an umbrella term meaning that someone''s attracted to more than
  one gender. That CAN be men and women but also includes other gender identities.
  Bi does come from "two" but by todays definition bisexuality isn''t just men
  and women anymore. Bi people are not attracted to multiple people at the same
  time unless they''re poly!
  Sexualities such as pan, poly, omni and others fall under the umbrella term "bi".
  Therefore every pansexual person is bi but not every bi person is pan. Just like
  every apple is a fruit but not every fruit is an apple.
